# C++SDK_Framework

This project is a C++ framework designed for controlling the JAKA Corobot and more. It combines a C++ backend for performance and efficiency with a React frontend Test utility to build a dynamic user interface.
## Key Features
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of complex computations and large data.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Uses Crow library for real-time web server interfaces.
- **Modularity**: Separation of frontend and backend for easier maintenance and extension.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increased complexity in robot control and user interface.
- **Session Management**: Robust mechanisms to track and manage user sessions securely.
- **CORS Support**: Secure API access from different origins.

## Benefits

- **Readability**: Separate header and source files for clear code understanding.
- **Reusability**: Header files can be included in multiple source files.
- **Compiling**: Only modified source files need recompilation, reducing build times.
- **Encapsulation**: Hides implementation details, exposing only inputs and outputs.


## Running the Project

- Use Visual Studio to build and run.
- Use run_program.bat to automate the build and run process on startup.

## Server and Middleware
- **Crow Web Framework**: Efficient web server creation.
- **CORS Middleware**: Ensures secure API access.
- **Session Management**: Functions for generating and managing session IDs and cookies.
